# UDOO NEO
**UDOO NEO** is an all-in-one open hardware low-cost computer equipped with a NXP&trade; i.MX 6SoloX applications processor for Android and Linux.

UDOO NEO embeds two cores on the same processor: a powerful 1GHz ARM® Cortex-A9, and an ARM Cortex-M4 I/O real-time co-processor that can run up to 200Mhz.

While the Cortex-A9 can run both Android Lollipop and [UDOObuntu 2](../Software_&_Operating_Systems/UDOObuntu.html) - a dedicated Ubuntu-based Linux distro - the Cortex-M4 allows easy access to a Arduino&trade; environment. The snap-in connector ensures a plug-and-play interaction with most sensors and actuators.

Thanks to its embedded 9-axis motion sensors and a Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0 module, the board is ideal to create robots, drones and rovers as well as any Mobile IoT project you can imagine.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> In order to prevent damages to your board, remember to:

* Never provide more than 3.3V in input to the GPIOs
* Never keep the board in touch with metal objects or surfaces while it is powered up


### Lineup
UDOO NEO retail line up consists of [three models](../Hardware_Reference/Board%20versions.html).
