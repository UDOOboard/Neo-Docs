<h1>UDOO NEO</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
	<strong>UDOO NEO</strong> is an all-in-one open hardware low-cost computer equipped with a FreescaleTM i.MX 6SoloX applications processor for Android and Linux.
<BR>
UDOO NEO embeds two cores on the same processor: a powerful 1GHz ARM® Cortex-A9, and up to a 200Mhz Cortex-M4 I/O real-time co-processor.
<BR>
While the Cortex-A9 can run both Android Lollipop and UDOObuntu 2, a dedicated Ubuntu-based Linux distro, the Cortex-M4 allows easy access to a full-stack ArduinoTM environment. The snap-in connector ensure a plug-and-play interaction with most sensors and actuators.
<BR>
Thanks to its embedded 9-axis motion sensors and Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0 module, the board is ideal to create robots, drones and rovers as well as any Mobile IoT project your imagination desires.
