What you should do now is downloading a suitable VNC client, like [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/) 
So, once downloaded just execute the program and install it.
Then, open the program: a window will pop up.

Assuming you connected to your UDOO Neo via the USB cable, type `192.168.7.2` in the VNC Server adddress, then press "Connect".

Then type your password (default password is *udooer*) and a new window will pop up in your desktop, that is the desktop of your UDOO Neo!
