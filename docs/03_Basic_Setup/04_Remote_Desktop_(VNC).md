What you should do now is downloading a suitable VNC client, like [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/) 
So, once downloaded just execute the program and install it.
Then, open the program: a window will pop up.

First of all, type 192.168.7.2 as VNC Server, then press "Connect".

Then type the password "udooer" and a new window will pop up in your desktop, that is the desktop of your UDOO Neo!
