### Are you a Windows or MAC user?
If you are a Windows or Mac user follow this guide [USB Direct Connection](http://www.udoo.org/docs-neo/Basic_Setup/Usb_Direct_Connection.html).

### Then... 
After you created a network interface between your PC and your UDOO Neo.
What you should do now is downloading a suitable VNC client, like [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/) 
So, once downloaded just execute the program and install it.
Then, open the program: a window will pop up.

First of all, type 192.168.7.2 as VNC Server, then press "Connect".
