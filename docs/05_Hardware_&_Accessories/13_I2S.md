## Pins

The IMX6 SoC provides those pins for I2S:
* TXFS: Transmit Frame Select
* TXC: Transmit Bit Clock
* TXD: Transmit Data
* RXFS: Receive Frame Select
* RXC: Receive Bit Clock
* RXD: Receive Data

|         | TXFS       | TXC     | TXD     | RXFS       | RXC | RXD |  Default core at boot |
|---------|------------|---------|---------|------------|-----|-----|-----------------------|
| AUD6    | 31         | 27      | 26      | 30         | 29  | 25  |  A9 (gpio mode)       |

## Example
Thanks to the **I²S bus** we can use audio codecs, such as DACs, with our UDOO
Neo enabling it via I2S.  As an example, we had already set a **ESS 9023** DAC card on that
bus, so you can use it plug and play.   
**Note**: the RX Pins are **not** enabled (only out).

To do so, just open the [Device Tree Editor](../Cookbook_Linux/Device_Tree_Editor.html) and enable the AUD pins. At the
next reboot, you will see an audio card installed in ALSA (even if it's not plugged).

```bash
# aplay -L
...
...
sysdefault:CARD=imxaudioes9023
    imx-audio-es9023, 
    Default Audio Device
dmix:CARD=imxaudioes9023,DEV=0
    imx-audio-es9023, 
    Direct sample mixing device
dsnoop:CARD=imxaudioes9023,DEV=0
    imx-audio-es9023, 
    Direct sample snooping device
hw:CARD=imxaudioes9023,DEV=0
    imx-audio-es9023, 
    Direct hardware device without any conversions
plughw:CARD=imxaudioes9023,DEV=0
    imx-audio-es9023, 
    Hardware device with all software conversions
```

To play simple audio WAV samples just use `aplay`.
```bash
# aplay -D plughw:CARD=imxaudioes9023,DEV=0 sample.wav
Playing WAVE 'sample.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo
```
