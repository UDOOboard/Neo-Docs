## Old school debugging
It is possible to use following old-school debugging techniques.

### Serial port
Use the [internal or the external serial port](../Arduino_M4_Processor/Communication.html) to dump on Linux debug messages.

### Pin 13 LED
This is a very dirty way to debug, but useful for simple sketches since it takes no time to setup.

Just control the digital pin 13 to get information on code running on M4 sketch.
