# External Arduino IDE

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span>A microSD with a with UDOOBuntu2 have to be up and running to program the Arduino&trade; M4 from an external PC. Expecially the USB direct Connection(USB OTG Gadget) and the UDOO FOTA server are the software needed.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span>For external programming the serial monitor doesnâ€™t work yet.

### Connect UDOO NEO

To use the External Arduino IDE follow the instructions below:

* Connect UDOO NEO via Micro USB Cable to your PC

* In order to use UDOO NEO'S USB Connection on Mac and Windows, you must install few drivers first as described in the [USB Direct Connection](../Basic_Setup/Usb_Direct_Connection.html).

### Install UDOO FOTA

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span>NOTE: If you use UDOOBuntu2 BETA 5 or previous versions you need to install the UDOO FOTA (Firmware over the Air) Server Package while if you use UDOOBuntu2 BETA 6 or later versions skip this step.

* To Install the UDOO FOTA you need to connect the board to internet using it either as a Computer or a Headless Device:

1. [Use as a Headless Device](../Getting_Started/Use_as_a_headless_IoT_Device.html)

2. [Use as a Computer](../Getting_Started/Use_as_a_Computer.html)

* Once you board is connected to internet open a terminal and type:

```bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install udoofota-server

```

### Install and configure the Arduino IDE

* From your computer go to the Arduino website and downlaod the last Arduino IDE version (currently 1.6.9): [Arduino IDE 1.6.9](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

* Select the OS you have in your computer and download the IDE then install it

* Open the IDE, go to `File -> Preferences` and add this link to `Additional Boards Manager URLs` and then click `OK`:  

      https://udooboard.github.io/arduino-board-package/package_udoo_index.json

<br />

* Go to `Tools -> Boards` and open the `Board Manager`.

* Wait few seconds 'till the end of the "index download" then look for `UDOO NEO (iMX6 SoloX) by UDOO Team` and install it.

* Done, now you're ready to use your UDOO NEO with the Arduino IDE installed on your Computer.

**N.B:** in order to get it working on Linux 64 bit you need compatibility packages:
$ sudo apt-get -y install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0
