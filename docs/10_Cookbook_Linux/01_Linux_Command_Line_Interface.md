## Overview

Visit our Tutorials section to learn more about: [Linux Command Line Interface](/tutorial/linux-command-line-interface/).

Linux Command Line Interface, (CLI from now on) could be at first glance discouraging for the average Joe, since nowadays we are only used to Graphic Interfaces. But don’t let you down, using a command line shell could be, not only  very useful, but also kind of  funny.
This Tutorial will help you move your first steps in the command shell environment.

First, when a Command Line Interface could be useful for you?


* Remote Connection <a href="http://www.udoo.org/ProjectsAndTutorials/connecting-via-serial-cable/?portfolioID=1394">via SSH</a>: SSH remote connection allows to interact with UDOO NEO without physical access to it. SSH is available only with command line interface.
* Using a minimal Linux Distribution without a graphical interface. Some Linux Distribution come without a Graphical User Interface, in order to maximize available resources. Command line interface is your only bet in this scenario
* Some power-users consider CLI the most convenient way to perform code execution and file-system operations. Even if you are not in this category, you may found out that CLI can be very fast when you get used to it.
* Showing up with your mates, the longest your CLI strings, the more rep you’ll get.



So, let’s start this adventure with the very basic Linux commands:

### sudo

Your first ally, allows users to run programs with the security privileges of root, or superuser.Its name is a concatenation of "su" (substitute user) and "do", or take action . So, if you get an error message saying that “only root can do that”, just use the same command with preceeded by sudo.

```bash

sudo

```

### sudo su
This just enables root privileges once for all, without forcing you to type sudo everytime. It works until you close the shell you are working into.

```bash

sudo su

```

### touch

create an empty file

```bash

touch

```

### nano
open an handy  text editor, to save and exit, press "ctrl" and "x", and tell yes or no by pressing "y" or "n"

```bash

nano

```

### cat

cat shows the content of a file, it speeds up file inspection for smaller files.

```bash

cat /etc/hostname

```

### ls

Shows you the content of a folder

```bash

ls

```

### cd
opens a specific folder

```bash

cd /home

cd ubuntu

```

### cd ..

Brings you to a higher folder level

```bash

cd /home/ubuntu
cd .. (/home)

```

#### cd /

brings you to root (top filesystem level)

```bash

cd /

```

#### rm

deletes a file

```bash

rm myfile.my

```

### rm -rf

deletes a folder

```bash

rm -rf /home/ubuntu/myfolder
rm -rf myfolder

```

### mv

moves a file or a folder. Useful for renaming also

```bash

mv myfile /myfolder/myfile
mv myfile mysecondfile

```


### cp

copies a file

```bash

cp myfile /home/ubuntu/

```

### cp -R

copies a folder

```bash

cp -R myfolder /home/ubuntu/myfolder

```

### mkdir

creates a folder

```bash

mkdir myfolder

```

### top

Top is a very useful utility, it basically gives you a complete overview of the system’s status. It produces an ordered list of running processes selected by user-specified criteria. Top shows how much processing power and memory are being used, as well as other information about the running processes.

```bash

top

```

### df -h

Shows used and available disk space, in megabytes.

```bash

df -h

```

### ifconfig -a

Shows networking useful data, like current ip, netmasks and other statistics.

```bash

ifconfig -a

```

### chmod

chmod let you set files permissions. This utility is very important for people concerned about security, but it is useful also for coders, since you can set a script as executable with it .

### dmesg
Shows the messages resulting from the most recent system boot. It is useful for troubleshooting, since you can see which modules are loaded, which binaries are started and so on.

```bash

dmesg

```

### sync

Thanks to this command your SD card lifespan will drastically improve, remember to launch it every time you turn UDOO NEO off, or remove the power. Completes all pending input/output operations. It must be launched as root, or with sudo.

```bash

sync

```

### reboot

reboots the system

```bash

reboot

```

### shutdown

shuts it down

```bash

shutdown now

```
