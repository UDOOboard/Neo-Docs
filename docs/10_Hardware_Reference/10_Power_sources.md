You can power up the board in 3 ways

* DC-jack: internal positive, Voltage 6 to 15.
* microUsb: 5 Volts up to 2 Ampere
* Vin / GND pin on external pinout

Providing the board with higher voltage could cause accidents or damage the board.
As you see in the picture Vin and inner DC-plug pole is the same node, so electrically they have the same characteristics.
