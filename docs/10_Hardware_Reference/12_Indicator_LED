Three LEDs are placed on the board, close to the RTC clock battery plug and to the Ethernet connector. They have three differents colors:
* Yellow, connected to Arduino pin 13. By default it’s available from M4 core.
* Red, by default it’s connected to A9. It’s available via kernel /sys/class/led/brightnessOut of the box, by default the LED blinks controlled by M4 to notify its status.
* Green, connected to PMIC. It turns on when the chip is powered.
