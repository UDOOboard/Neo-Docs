A single HDMI interface is connected to the 16 bit LCD interface on the processor. The 16 bit interface is used to preserve as many expansion pins as possible to allow the use by the user. The NXP TDA19988BHN is used to convert the LCD interface to HDMI and convert the audio as well. The default resolution is set to 1024 x 768.
