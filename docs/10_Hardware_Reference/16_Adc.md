The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a successive approximation ADC designed for operation within an integrated microcontroller system-on-chip.
By default the ADC units can be accessed from M4.

### Usage
You can use ADC exactly as in Arduino UNO sketches.

``` bash
int adc = analogRead(A0);
```
