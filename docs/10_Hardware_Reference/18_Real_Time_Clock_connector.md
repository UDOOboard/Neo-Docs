UDOO Neo exposes a connector to plug the Real-Time Clock module to allow the CPU time clock to stay up to date. This is available on the J6 connector. It works with a 3V battery.

**Warning:** the RTC clock on UDOO NEO is not working properly. The hardware is perfectly functional, but the software needs to be refined. Please be patient, the adjustment is coming.
