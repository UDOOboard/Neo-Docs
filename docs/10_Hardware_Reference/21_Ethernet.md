The MAC-NET core of i.MX 6SoloX, in conjunction with a 10/100/1000 MAC, implements layer 3
network acceleration functions. These functions are designed to accelerate the processing
of various common networking protocols, such as IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP, providing
wire speed services to client applications.
A physical layer is implemented by KSZ8091RNA chip. The KSZ8091RNA is a single-supply 10Base-T/100Base-TX Ethernet physical-layer transceiver for transmission and reception of data over standard CAT-5 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable. The KSZ8091RNA is a highly-integrated PHY solution. It reduces the cost of the board and simplifies the board layout by using on-chip termination resistors for the differential pairs and by integrating a low-noise regulator to supply the 1.2V core and finally, by offering a flexible 1.8/2.5/3.3V digital I/O interface.
