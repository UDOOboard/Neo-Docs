Serial Libraries Communication Samples for [UDOO Board](http://www.udoo.org)

These scripts are examples meant to demonstrate how to implement a uni/bidirectional communication between an Arduino sketch (running on Cortex-M4 Arduino&trade; Compatible processor) and a binary application on iMX6 Linux processor.

The Arduino sketch will remain the same no matter which programming language youâ€™ll use to develop the binary on iMX6.

There are two example scripts for each programming language: C, Java, PHP, Python.

You can find the whole repo in our [Github Channel](https://github.com/UDOOboard/serial_libraries_examples).
Clone the repo in your system using this command on a terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/UDOOboard/serial_libraries_examples.git

Each program is meant to be executed while the matching Arduino Sketch is running on SAM3X.

Program the Arduino&trade; embedded with the sketch named `arduino_serial_example.ino` before run these examples:

    c_serial_example.c
    java_serial_example.java
    php_serial_example.php
    python_serial_example.py


Program the Arduino&trade; embedded with the sketch named `arduino_serial_example_bidirectional.ino` before run these examples:

    c_serial_example_bidirectional.c
    java_serial_example_bidirectional.java
    php_serial_example_bidirectional.php
    python_serial_example_bidirectional.py
