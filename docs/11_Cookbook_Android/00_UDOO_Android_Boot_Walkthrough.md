<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> We are working to solve the current issues to deliver a complete support:
-bug fix to the Bluetooth stack (audio streaming);
-Arduino support to Android.

At the moment it's not possible to use together Android and Arduino.
Sorry for the inconvenient, we are all after this.
