# Programming Arduino from external PC doesn't work
What's your IDE version?

## I'm using Arduino IDE 1.6.6
For the moment you should use the [1.6.5 IDE version](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous).

## I'm using Arduino IDE 1.6.7
For the moment you should use the (1.6.5 IDE version)[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous].

## Why?
Arduino IDE changed in the last two version its Board Manager. It will become compatible with the lastest versions as soon as possible.
