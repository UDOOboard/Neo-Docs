## Install the required packages

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gawk wget git diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib \
         build-essential chrpath socat libsdl1.2-dev xterm picocom ncurses-dev lzop \
         gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf

## Get the kernel sources from GitHub
Create a develop folder

    mkdir udooneo-dev
    cd udooneo-dev

then download the sources:

    git clone https://github.com/UDOOboard/linux_kernel
    cd linux_kernel

The default branch `3.14-1.0.x-udoo` is the one where we are working on for the UDOO NEO. It is based on 3.14.56 Freescale community kernel.


## Load the default kernel configuration
UDOO Neo has a dedicated default kernel configuration that you can import with:

    ARCH=arm make udoo_neo_defconfig

## (optional) Personalize the kernel configuration
Add or remove kernel modules to fit your project:

    ARCH=arm make menuconfig

## Compile sources
To build the kernel image, type:

    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- make zImage -j5

You can safely tweak the `-jX` parameter. For instance, on quad core CPUs with two threads per core, you can use `-j8`.

The build can take several minutes, approximately from 2 to 15, depending on your PC host or VM configuration.

## Compile Device Trees

    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- make dtbs -j5


## Compile the modules

    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- make modules -j5


### Copy the kernel to the SD card

You can overwrite the kernel on a UDOObuntu SD card with the following commands:

    BOOT_PARTITION=/path/to/boot-partition
    ROOT_PARTITION=/path/to/root-partition
    
    cp arch/arm/boot/zImage $BOOT_PARTITION
    cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb $BOOT_PARTITION/dts
    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- make firmware_install modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=$ROOT_PARTITION
