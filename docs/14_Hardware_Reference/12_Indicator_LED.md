Three LEDs are placed on the board, close to the RTC clock battery plug and to the Ethernet connector.

They have three different colors:
* Orange, connected to Arduino pin 13. By default it is available from M4 core;
* Red, by default it is connected to A9 and shows SD card input/output activity;
* Green, connected to PMIC. It turns on when the chip is powered.
