The MAC-NET core of i.MX 6SoloX, in conjunction with a 10/100 MAC, implements layer 3 network acceleration functions. These functions are designed to accelerate the processing of various common networking protocols, such as IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP, providing wire speed services to client applications.
A physical layer is implemented by KSZ8091RNA chip.

The KSZ8091RNA is a single-supply 10Base-T/100Base-TX Ethernet physical-layer transceiver for transmission and reception of data over standard CAT-5 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable.
